# HR_Analytics

In this project, we predict if the potential hr candidates are promoted or not based on their past records, training score, education, awards they have won in their period of service etc.
Missing data is filled with the mode value of that column. MinMaxScaler is used for standardization and Xgboosting model is used for prediction whose parameters are tuned using GridSearch.
